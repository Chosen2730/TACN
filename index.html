                    Calvary greetings to you in the name of God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ Who has blessed us in Christ with every 
                    spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm. To Him be Glory, Power, Honour and Dominion now and Forever, Amen!
                    <br><br>

                    We give glory to God for his unflinching Love, Peace and Mercy over this Household, for His words and covenant that has always come true to 
                    us, for his eminent reign since ages past and even till date. Not by power, nor by our might but by the spirit of the Lord, and we are 
                    convinced and sure of this very thing, that He Who began this good work in us will continue until the day of Jesus Christ, developing and 
                    perfecting and bringing it to full completion in us! (Phil 1:6).
                    <br><br>

                    The Promise of the Lord towards us at this time is "RESTORATION". And I will restore for you the years that the locust has eatenâ€“the hopping locust, 
                    the stripping locust, and the crawling locust, My great army which I sent among you (Joel 2:25). It's the time of replenishment, rebuilding, renewal, 
                    remoulding and revival, God is said to do a new thing and the time is now. The Lord is here to restore our relationship with the father, to build us 
                    as a Holy and Righteous temple of God, to raise men whose academic stance will show forth the glory of the father, to raise armies who will stand for 
                    God in all aspects of life even in these last days.

                    <br><br>

                    Brethren, with Jesus Joy in my heart: I announce to you that the New Glory has come to stay in our Lives, Families, and Academics...The latter glory 
                    of this house shall be greater than the former, says the Lord of hosts; and in this place will I give peace and prosperity, says the Lord of hosts (Haggai 2:9).

                    <br><br>

                    The reward for work well done is more work: let us all journey together with the Chief_Restorer even as we receive the New Glory. For those who wait 
                    for the Lord [who expect, look for, and hope in Him] shall renew their strength and power; they shall lift their wings and mount up as eagles; they shall run and 
                    not be weary, they shall walk and not faint or become tired. To this end we raise a Clarion call unto all, let us walk in this path of Restoration together.

                    <br><br>
                    May the God of peace Himself sanctify and separate you from profane things, make you pure and wholly consecrated to himself; and may your spirit, soul and body be preserved sound and completely blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you all. <br><br> Amen
                    <br><br>
