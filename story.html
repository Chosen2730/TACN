                    In The Beginning- The Executives The Apostolic Church Students' Fellowship of Nigeria(TACSFON) of The Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta(FUNAAB) then known as UNAAB was inaugurated by the then (The Apostolic Church Isale- Igbein District Under Abeokuta Area) Apostle, Pastor J.A Akintola(now the Superintendent of Sango Area Headquarters, Ibadan) in the Sunday School Hall of the church on Sunday, May 24, 1992 with about 7-10 students. 
                    <br><br> With the assent of the then Vice Chancellor, Professor Nimbe Adedipe, the Fellowship started to hold meetings once in a week (Wednesdays 6-7pm) on the school campus which was situated then at Isale-Igbein. It was in one of the meetings that the agreement was reached to have a Coordinator and to be assisted by other brethren(not Executives). 
                    <br><br> This was done via nomination and availability and we're known as the Pro-executives . Brother B.J.O Ayorinde was chosen as the Coordinator. Brother Sunday Emmanuel was the General Secretary and Brother John Abel was the Prayer Secretary. Afore the expiration of their stay in school, there was a need to handover the baton of Leadership. The transition process was conducted and Bro Adekanbi was chosen as the first President while Sister Sola Ogunade(nee Ojo) geld the posts of the General Secretary and Sisters' Coordinator.
                    <br><br> Till date, TACSFON FUNAAB has produced 21 Presidents, 25 General Secretaries, 18 Sisters' Coordinators and other numerous executive members whose names are written in the annuals of the Fellowship's history. <br><br>
                  
                  <span class="para_about">FELLOWSHIP MEETINGS AND PERMANENT SITE BUILDING</span> 
                  As reported earlier, the Fellowship started at the Children's Sunday school hall of TAC Isale-Igbein Assembly. After 2 yrs, she transited to the School campus and had her meetings in Classroom 08 close to the cafeteria on Wednesdays. On moving to permanent site at Alabata in 1998, a place of worship became necessary. Albeit, members temporarily met at Isale-Igbein and sometimes at TAC Obantoko Assembly. THE PRE-DEGREE, FSP and SLT students met at Isale-Igbein for fellowship while the bonafide Undergraduates met at Obantoko Assembly.
                  <br><br> 
                  Later, the Fellowship moved her meeting point to TAC Camp Assembly which was seen as a more central location. Grievances of movement by brethren during the Mid-week services and the tiresome nature of school work led to the creation of three centres:Obantoko, Camp and Permanent site. Sunday program held at 2-5pm at TAC Camp Assembly while Prayer meeting and Bible Study held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays respectively in all three centres at 6pm.
                  <br><br>       In the 2003/2004 Spiritual year, as a result of the increase in the number of brethren and the TAC Camp Assembly auditorium not large enough for the members, it was resolved that a piece of land be secured. In March 2007, at a total cost of N250000, a 2-plot piece of land was purchased at Isolu, Alabata where the Fellowship's edifice currently stands. The First Sunday service conducted in the morning commenced in 2008(Sunday programmes had always been in the afternoon) under a makeshift tent.
                  <br><br>Also, according to Elder Kuforiji who has been with the fellowship since inception amidst company of other Elders. One of them of blessed memory now,  Overseer Engineer Wale Bajomo who fought to establish this TACSFON as most of our baba don't really have full support for the student body establishment. In his words, 'They were thinking the other way round that he want to give the young people chance and that is Elder Toyin Ayinde who was the former commissioner of Urban and Regional planning in Lagos state during Fashola regime but I doubt iif he is in The Apostolic church till now.
                  
                  <br><br>The start was .. you know when you want to build a house, where the problem is, is the foundation so your predecessors they really tried and we joined hands together, like when they started as young people.. Yoruba say “Ti omo ba sipa obi e ale gbe” so they really started very strong, when it now got to the stage of buying that land, I as an estate surveyor and a land expert I had to come in and contribute my own quota as a professional and a little finance that I had to do. They came to me every now and then asking what next sir, how do we go and after it all, we thank God the approval of the land we have it.
                  <br><br>
                  
                  <span class="para_about">MINI CAMPUS</span> 
                          The mini-campus Fellowship meant for Pre-degree, SLT and FSP students, was established at Isale-Igbein( the then mini-campus) but now at Mawuko. She had her fellowship meetings on Wednesdays between the hours of 1-3pm but now hold Sunday programmes with her own set of executives (supervised by the mini-campus' executives headed by the Vice President 2 and assisted by other Executives assigned to the mini-campus). Bible study/Prayer meeting holds on Wednesdays among others.
                          <br><br>
                  
                  <span class="para_about"> BELIEVERS' SCHOOL</span>
                       In the 2004/2005 Spiritual year, the BELIEVERS' SCHOOL was established. Members are expected to undergo classes, write an Examination and attend an interview before they can be recognized as Workers in the household. Certificates are then awarded there-after. The first set of participants' graduation ceremony was held on March 30,2005. The first Principal of the school was Brother Daniel Ogunsola . Presently, the Vice President 1 is also the Principal of the Believers' school.
                       <br><br> In 2007/2008 the school was divided into two arms: Membership class (a 7-week course meant for new members) and Workers' class( to prepare and equip members so as to render effective service in the household) who would go on to be Executives.

                  <span class="para_about">Alumni BODY AND REUNION PROGRAMME</span>
                    The reunion programme is a special annual event where former and incumbent students of this great institution come together in fellowship with God.
                  <br><br>May 8th,1999 marks the inauguration of the alumni body which gave birth to the first reunion programme on March 4th, 2000. On that day, seven(7) members of the Alumni body were in attendance. With the exception of the years 2003 and 2014, 2019, fifteen (15) reunion programmes have been held.
                  <br><br>
                  <span class="para_about">MISCELLANEOUS</span>
                      In her twenty-six (26) years of existence, TACSFON FUNAAB has engaged in many activities am programmes that have been beneficial to her members, students of FUNAAB and surrounding communities. Few among them are : Village Outreach (2001,2005,2009,2013,2016) , TACSFON Week (2005/2006, 2013/2014, 2015/2016, 2019, 2021), Prayord Conference (2017/2017), Magazine Launch (2006, 2021), Welcome/Send-forth(2001- date), Induction (1993-date), Anniversary (10th; 2002, 20th; 2012 and 25th; 2017) and other programmes too numerous to be mentioned.
                  <br><br>
                  Through so many rigours, issues and seemingly insurmountable challenges within and without, TACSFON FUNAAB has scaled through it all rooting all of her teachings and doctrines on the SCRIPTURE as we raise the fluttering flag chanting our mantra saying LET NO MAN DESPISE THY YOUTH (1TIM 4:12).
